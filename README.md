## üìò Example Use Case

> **Rahul**, a product manager, uploads meeting notes, blog links, and internal documentation.  
> An urgent meeting is scheduled in an hour. The person originally in charge is on sick leave, and Rahul must take over the presentation.  
> He needs to quickly prepare and understand the key concepts from his own documents.  
>
> He asks:  
> ‚ÄúWhat were the key decisions from last month‚Äôs planning meetings?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúSummarize the 2024 business plan.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúAdd the summary to the Notion page.‚Äù  
>  
> Gomm AI provides a smart, context-aware summary, saving time and boosting clarity.

## üèóÔ∏è Solution Architecture

This workflow illustrates how an AI personal assistant processes raw data and enables users to interact with it through a chatbot.
Users begin by uploading various types of content such as meeting documents, business plans (PDFs), or text gathered from web scraping. These files are stored in **Azure Blob Storage**.
Once a file is uploaded, an **Azure Function Trigger** is automatically activated. This serverless function processes the file, extracts its contents, and saves the structured data into **Azure Cosmos DB**.
The stored data is then utilized by the AI assistant. 

At the same time, **Azure AI Search** indexes the content, allowing relevant information to be retrieved quickly when the user asks a question.
Using **OpenAI models**, the assistant analyzes the stored content, understands user queries, and generates meaningful, context aware responses. The system also stores chat history in Cosmos DB to maintain continuity in conversations.
If **Notion** is integrated, the assistant can fetch content directly from Notion pages or update them with AI-generated summaries and insights using the Python `notion-client` library.
Users interact with the chatbot through text or voice input. The chatbot forwards the message to OpenAI, fetches relevant information from indexed documents or Cosmos DB, and provides a response.
Overall, this serverless and automated system streamlines the entire workflow, minimizing manual effort while enabling intelligent, real time interaction with personalized content.

## üìÅ Resources

I attended the **Cognizant AI for Impact: APJ GenAI Skills Program 2025 ‚Äì Prompt Engineering Workshop** and learned how to effectively use AI prompting to extract insights.  
The methods taught in that session were applied in Gomm AI to enhance debugging and user interaction.
