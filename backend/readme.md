### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Set Up

1. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### üîë Key Backend Features

**Routes:**

* `/notion`: Handles Notion API interactions
* `/chat`: Processes AI chat prompts and responses
* `/document`: Manages document uploads and parsing

**Services:**

* `cosmos_service.py`: Manages communication with Azure Cosmos DB
* `openai_service.py`: Handles interaction with Azure OpenAI

**Deployment:**

* `deploy.zip`: Azure Function trigger package for serverless deployment

### ‚ö° Azure Function Trigger

The original concept was implemented using a local Flask server. However, to automate the workflow, an **Azure Function Trigger** was introduced. It runs automatically when a user uploads a document to **Azure Blob Storage**, processes the document, and stores the result in **Cosmos DB**.
This serverless approach reduces manual effort and simplifies the overall system architecture.

### üß† Notion API Integration

I initially attempted to integrate **Notion MCP**, but it was not available at the time.
As an alternative, I used the **Python Notion API client** (`notion-client` library).
In the future, I plan to integrate more advanced features using **OpenAI models**.
While working with the Notion API, I encountered several debugging challenges and had to ensure each endpoint existed and functioned correctly.
